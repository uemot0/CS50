Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 simulations
